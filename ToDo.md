- [x] advanced distance calculation, that takes walls into account 
    - [x] make a grpah connecting a cell with it's 4 adjacent cells
    - [x] specify the target cell
    - [x] using bfs or dfs find out the distance to cells
    - [x] when robot is traveling, cut off edges of the graph based on the walls,
    - [x] re calculate the distances

- [x] Plan the return trip
    - [ ] calculate the unexplored areas
    - [ ] findout where you can enter those areas
    - [ ] travel to those areas on the return trip maximizing explored area

- [ ] optimize the search run 
    - [ ] between two paths which are close by manhatton distance, take into account the time take to travel by 
    - [ ] estimating acceleration, deceleration and max v

- [ ] identify straight sections
- [ ] calculate acceleration , max speed and deceration distances
