# Micro Mouse Robot Navigation Algorithm

## Overview

This repository will contain a set of algorithms designed to navigate a Micro Mouse robot through a labyrinth. The focus is on exploring the use of graph-based techniques, such as Flood Fill and Breadth-First Search (BFS), to solve maze navigation challenges.
And to optimize the return run bye trying to visit large unexplored areas on return run. maximizing the total explored area of the labrynth. Also fast run optimizations will be done by calculating acceleration, maximum velocity and deceleration periods for a section. 

## Algorithms

### 1. Flood Fill Algorithm
- **Description**: The Flood Fill algorithm is used to explore the maze by filling each cell with a number representing the distance from the goal. The robot then follows the path with the lowest value to reach the destination.
- **Usage**: This algorithm is useful for creating a potential field within the maze, allowing the robot to make decisions on which path to take based on proximity to the goal.

### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Description**: BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the maze level by level, ensuring the shortest path to the goal is found. It uses a queue to keep track of the next cells to explore.
- **Usage**: BFS is ideal for scenarios where finding the shortest path from the start to the goal is critical. It's particularly effective in labyrinths with multiple possible routes.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithms, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/micromouse-navigation-algorithms.git
   cd micromouse-navigation-algorithms
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the provided `requirements.txt` for Python projects:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Algorithms**:
   Execute the algorithms on sample mazes provided in the `mazes/` directory:
   ```bash
   python run_flood_fill.py
   python run_bfs.py
   ```
